# ricechessboard
Program that prints how many grains of rice there are on each square of a chessboard, and prints the total amount on the entire board.

If/When the numbers become very large, you should switch to a larger unit when printing the number.

Use the following:
	*1kg = 50,000 grains
	*1 ton = 1000 kg
	*Titanic = 52,000 tons
	*The Empire State Building weights 365000 tons
	*Hoover Dam - 6,600,000 tons
	*1 cubic km of rice - 1,000,000,000 tons
	*Total Coal reserves in China (as of 2009) = 1,730,000,000 tons
